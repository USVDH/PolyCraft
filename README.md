# Polycraft

# THIS IS STILL HEAVILY UNDER DEVELOPMENT!!!

Version 2.0 of the private Minecraft survival server Polycraft. 

## Getting Started

This repo will include everything that is needed to reproduce a similar server, with the exception of sensitive data such as the whitelist, API keys etc. 

## Background

PolyCraft V1 officially started in 2016 at Minecraft version 1.10 (Java), but has had numerous predecessors dating back to 2010. With the codebase for PolyCraft V1 becoming 5 years old, I thought I'd be a good idea to make a V2 from scratch in preperation for Minecraft version 1.18. 

## Key Features

* Quality of life features such as /spawn, /home and /tpa.
* Crossplay with Java and Bedrock thanks to [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/)
* Full-fledged integration with Discord (i.e. Chat Relay) thanks to [DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/) and [RelayItToDiscord](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/relayittodiscord.34615/)
* Numerous anti-lag measures thanks to [FarmControl](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/farmcontrol-1-15-1-17.86923/) and [LagMonitor](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lagmonitor.21348/), as well as [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/)
* Anti-grief measures with [CoreProtect](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/coreprotect.8631/) and [InventoryRollback](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/inventory-rollback.48074/)

## How to use 

This repo is provided without the server .jar file and plugin .jar files, please download them from their respective creators. To get a working Minecraft server use the next steps: 
1. Download [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) and put the .jar file into the root folder
2. Download all the plugins and put them into /plugins
3. Customize the startfile to your liking

And you're done! Now you have a fully working server.
